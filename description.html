								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>Currently, biopsies are the most common procedures used to diagnose cancer. Although they provide accurate examinations of the tissue, they continue to be invasive methods of diagnosis. Additionally, biopsies are generally quite costly and time consuming. ASTRO describes that the average cost of a biopsy is $14,634. The procedure involves the removal of an area of tissue, ranging in size from thin layers to large lumps, and careful analysis of this tissue under a microscope.</p>

								<p>According to the Cancer Network, the average cost of a lung needle biopsy is $12,888. The procedure itself can be performed in an hour, but the recovery can take several days. Many types of biopsies, such as vacuum-assisted and surgical, require extensive areas of tissue to increase the accuracy of the analysis. Although the fine needle and endoscopic biopsies are less invasive, they have been proven to be less accurate and are thus less reliable methods of diagnosis.</p>
								<p>Research shows that lung cancer patients exhale a specific signature of volatile organic compounds. With sensitive sensors that can detect the slightest differences between the signatures of healthy patients and those with lung cancer,  our system involves the use of two highly sensitive nanosensors that detect respective concentrations of acetone and toluene.</p>

								<h3>History</h3>
								<p>Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancers and while currently there is no cure, there are many known causes. According to the WebMD, the excessive use of tobacco accounts for 90% of non-small cell lung cancers. However, the harm is in the cigarette smoke, so secondhand smokers are at risk for lung cancer as well. Another known cause of lung cancer is the exposure to radiation. According to UpToDate, the radioactive gas, Radon, is often trapped in houses and can be very dangerous if it is inhaled. Additionally, UpToDate states that other factors of the development of lung cancer include exposure to “dusts and fumes from nickel, chromium, and other similar agents in metal-working industries”.</p>
								<p>The Mayo Clinic explains that the carcinogens that come from inhaling cigarette smoke greatly damage the cells in the lining inside the lungs, many times resulting in the abnormal behavior of these cells. The basis of lung cancer is the unusually rapid division of mature cells. According to UpToDate, some of the symptoms of lung cancer include chronic coughs, wheezing, chest pains, unusual breathing patterns, and upper body aches. </p>
								<p>There are no known cures, however, there are many measures that can be taken to prevent the development of lung cancer. Since the main cause of lung cancer is from smoking cigarettes, the main method of prevention is to refrain from doing so. But the same harms can come from secondhand smoking as well, because the inhalation of the smoke is the real danger, so secondhand smoking must be avoided as well. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention explains that another way to prevent this is to make sure that houses and public buildings are free of radon and radioactive gases.</p>
								<p>There are many current methods of detecting lung cancer in its developing stages, the most common including x-rays, bone scans, PET-CT scans, low-dose CT scans, and biopsies. While these screening and diagnostic methods provide solutions, each one proves to have its own drawbacks. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence explains that the chest x-ray is generally the first test performed on a patient when there is an abnormality in the lungs, however, this test fails to show is whether or not the person certainly has lung cancer. It is nearly impossible to analyze a chest x-ray and differentiate between developments of lung cancer and other conditions. Bone scans solve this problem because they can accurately detect both the existence of lung cancer as well as how much it has spread. The WebMD describes that bone scans are done by inserting a radioactive tracer material a vein in the arm and allowing a camera to take pictures, providing detailed images of the affected areas. But the harm in this is that the effects of the use of the tracer are potentially detrimental. In fact, substantial exposure to ionizing radiation can potentially lead to the risk of developing cancer where it didn’t already exist, or worsening existing conditions. The source also explains that there is often swelling or soreness in the where the needle is inserted and there is a risk of damage to the tissue, making this method quite invasive. Another method is the PET-CT scan, otherwise known as the Positron Emission Tomography-Computerised Tomography scan. This method, similar to the bone scan, involves the use of radioactive material that helps detect active cancer cells. While this is a painless process, the negative side effects are similar to those of bone scans. The radioactivity of the material poses a threat to the cells surrounding the area where the material is injected and the needle itself makes the procedure invasive. Additionally, this method is expensive, as it can often cost between $1,000 and $1,400. The low-dose CT scan, Computerised-Tomography scan, is another method that uses X-Rays to project of the internal structures, however, the images have proven to be inaccurate in some cases and the process can be expensive. The CT scan alone is less effective than the PET-CT scan because it doesn’t create images in color that show the functional capacities of different regions of tissues. The biopsy, another common method, is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of a region of tissue that is later analyzed under a microscope. This procedure is invasive, as it requires the use of a needle to remove the tissue, and is also expensive. Additionally, anesthesia is often required as this process is painful. Many of these methods are also time consuming, as the processes themselves can take from 10 minutes to a few hours, and this doesn’t include the amount of time it takes to receive the results and recover from the procedure. </p>

								<h3>Future Technology</h3>
								<p>Current screening and diagnostic methods for lung cancer are expensive, invasive, and cumbersome to use. For example, an average lung biopsy costs well over ten thousand dollars, and also requires the removal of delicate tissue through a surgical process. Our vision is to develop a user friendly, low cost and non-invasive system that improves upon the numerous drawbacks of current technologies for this issue. According to SOURCE, non lung cancer patients exhale on average about 600 parts per billion (ppb) of acetone, and a negligible amount of toluene. On the contrary, the amount of toluene in a lung cancer patient’s breath increases to about 30 ppb, and the amount of acetone comes down to about 450 ppb creating a ratio of toluene to acetone of about 1 to 15. By accurately measuring the differences in these ratios with gas nanosensors, we can accurately diagnose a patient with lung cancer. By using two nanosensors, and calibrating one to measure high concentrations of acetone at the parts per billion scale, and calibrating the second sensor to measure high concentrations of toluene, we can successfully measure the ratio between these two gases.</p>
								<hr />

								<h3>Breakthroughs</h3>
								<p>On November 5th, 2015, the ARUP, a nonprofit enterprise of the University of Utah and its Department of Pathology, discovered that since the most common methods of non-small lung cancer diagnosis are either too expensive, invasive, or inaccurate, the use of cell-free tumor DNA, also known as ctDNA, is an effective alternative. The ctDNA method, referred to as the “liquid biopsy”, involves the use of the patient’s blood sample and it results in the diagnosis of cancer and recurrence. It can also be used in the later stages of cancer when the patient is undergoing a process of treatment in order to test whether or not certain drugs are helping the patient. </p>
								<hr />

								<h3>Design Process</h3>
								<p>Using a 1 liter erlenmeyer flask, two high sensitive gas nanosensors, and respective amounts of acetone and toluene, we can test the accuracy of our model. Then, an arduino is used to take readings ten times a second to ensure consistent measurements. After importing this data, we then graph the outputted measurements to analyze the ratio of the two gases in the gas sample. Since we use volatile compounds in the liquid form, we must wait for the compounds to completely evaporate and evenly disperse throughout the container. To know the point at which the acetone and toluene molecules are completely dispersed, we look at the graphs that we plot. As the liquid begins to evaporate the ppm at any given spot in the container will rise and the peak of the graph shows the time at which the gasses are evenly dispersed. This design is fast, cheap, and most importantly noninvasive, as it simply asks for the user to puff into the analyzer.</p>
								<hr />

								<h3>Consequences</h3>
								<p>No model will be completely perfect as there will always be some drawbacks. Although there are no consequences from using our device, there are a few limitations in the application of the mechanism. While our method is more accurate than most of the current methods, its main drawback is that it is not as accurate as it theoretically could be. Additionally, although our system is able to detect whether a patient has lung cancer or not, it is unable to identify the stage. More specific data gives doctors an idea of the necessary treatments for the patient. We used nanosensors that measure gasses in parts per million as this model is a proof of concept, but a sensor that would do the same in parts per billion could make make our model far more accurate.</p>
